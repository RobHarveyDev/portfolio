# Portfolio
A simple personal website build using [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Get started
1.  **Clone the project**
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/DrCake/Portfolio.git
    ```
    or with GitHub CLI
    ```shell
    gh repo clone DrCake/Portfolio
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```shell
    composer install
    ```
   ```shell
    npm install
    ```
3. **Serve the website locally**
    
    A) Using PHP
    ```shell
    ./vendor/bin/jigsaw serve
    ```
    Then the website will be available at http://localhost:8000. This does not support hot-reloading, for that use the npm command

    b) Using NPM
    ```shell
    npm run watch
    ```
    This will automatically open a new tab with the site and be reloaded when a change is made.
